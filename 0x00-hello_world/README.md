# 0x00. C - Hello, World Tasks 

**Task 0:** A script that runs a C file through the preprocessor and save the result into another file.

                      The C file name will be saved in the variable "$CFILE"
                      The output should be saved in the file "c"

**Task 1:** A script that compiles a C file but does not link.

                      The C file name will be saved in the variable "$CFILE"
                      The output file should be named the same as the C file, but with the extension ".o" instead of ".c"
                          Example: if the C file is "main.c", the output file should be "main.o"

**Task 2:** A script that generates the assembly code of a C code and save it in an output file.

                      The C file name will be saved in the variable "$CFILE"

                          Example: if the C file is "main.c", the output file should be "main.s"

**Task 3:** A script that compiles a C file and creates an executable named `cisfun`. The C file name will be saved in the variable `$CFILE`

**Task 4:** A script that creates an empty file called `hello`
